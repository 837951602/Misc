1. A list is lengthed and size the sum of length of elements
2. An integer x is lengthed 1 and size x
3. A large integer x is lengthed and size k=productlog(x), expressed in base-O(k)
4. The bitwidth is O(log n) where n is maximum size of all elements
5. Any calculating is O(1) if the 2k-bit version can be done with O(1) k-bit version
6. Any calculating is O(1) if a O(1) calculating defined in 5 return it as part of answer
7. A RAM contains n^O(1) units, where each unit can store an integer, a reference or another RAM(that's to avoid insufficant memory)

Let A and B are two far positions, 50 ly. P at B at 0.999c towards A.

P see slow motion of A and A see slow motion of P. To make them agree time when P reaches A, P currently feel A 50 y later.
Besides, PA is shortened.

B sees P slow. Cuz effect of shorten and slowen are same ratio, from A to P take B's 50 y. Since P treat A 50 y earlier,
P see A's current and send to B.

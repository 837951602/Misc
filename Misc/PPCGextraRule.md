  * Here, by "unnecessary", you shouldn't reduce a fetch by adding some other similar fetch back.
* While copying other answer, if possible, you should mark as community wiki. Same answer in a same question should be avoided. ([/a/1080/](https://codegolf.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1080/), [/a/16363/](https://codegolf.meta.stackexchange.com/a/16363/))

* You should use a language that others have easy access to. ([/a/7212/](https://codegolf.meta.stackexchange.com/a/7212/))
* By default, you shouldn't post a snippet, while full program and functions are allowed. ([/a/1146/](https://codegolf.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1146/))
* You should at least try to make your answer better. ([/a/1063/](https://codegolf.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1063/), [/a/1916/](https://codegolf.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1916/), [/a/8246/](https://codegolf.meta.stackexchange.com/a/8246/))

# Code-golf

* Answering in any language and interperter is allowed. It's fine to ignore ones newer than the question for a win criticia, though.
  * For ones that created or specializationed for the question, it's encouraged to ignore while sorting, and downvote. ([/a/1071/](https://codegolf.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1071/), [/a/5076/](https://codegolf.meta.stackexchange.com/a/5076/), [/a/5800/](https://codegolf.meta.stackexchange.com/a/5800/), [/a/12714/](https://codegolf.meta.stackexchange.com/a/12714/))
* If your program relies on some extra info other than containment(filename, modified time, current time, etc.), it counts as part of length. ([/a/1072/](https://codegolf.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1072/), [/a/12271/](https://codegolf.meta.stackexchange.com/a/12271/))
* You shouldn't solve everything and pick the required one, e.g.
  * Generating all possible functions/programs ([/a/9034/](https://codegolf.meta.stackexchange.com/a/9034/))
  * Take program as input of enum ([/a/14110/](https://codegolf.meta.stackexchange.com/a/14110/))
  * Run everything, each resulting in its file.

# Fastest-code

* Optimizing for given test cases is not allowed. ([/a/2507/](https://codegolf.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2507/))

# Quine

* For questions tagged "quine", each bit in an answer should not be both code and data, and there should be at least something that don't mean to output itself, push itself which will be outputted later, or something that behaves same (e.g. claiming `1` pushes 2 and a pushed 2 outputs a `1`).

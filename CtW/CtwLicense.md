CtW is willing to create and share Minecraft works. However, to avoid some unnecessary mess, users trying to destroy the sharing environment are banned:

* The RedPixel, Copying and claiming as author. Create 3 more works to get rid of the limitation.
* 玄素, 引战(original words), discouraging or disallowing creating in a minecraft forum. Apologize to get rid since the old rule didn't consider such situation.
